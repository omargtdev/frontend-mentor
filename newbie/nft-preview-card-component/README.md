## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS BEM Methond
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to give an effect hover to an image. I needed to wrap the
image with a sibling div. Also, I practiced BEM method in CSS.

```html
<div class="img-container">
  <img class="nft__img" src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Equilibrium - NFT">
  <div class="img-preview">
    <svg width="48" height="48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M0 0h48v48H0z"/><path d="M24 9C14 9 5.46 15.22 2 24c3.46 8.78 12 15 22 15 10.01 0 18.54-6.22 22-15-3.46-8.78-11.99-15-22-15Zm0 25c-5.52 0-10-4.48-10-10s4.48-10 10-10 10 4.48 10 10-4.48 10-10 10Zm0-16c-3.31 0-6 2.69-6 6s2.69 6 6 6 6-2.69 6-6-2.69-6-6-6Z" fill="#FFF" fill-rule="nonzero"/></g></svg>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I need to redefine the html layout and learn more about the use of variables in CSS.

## Acknowledgments

I think to do projects are better than read or watch videos all the time about Web devlopment, I'm not saying
you don't need to study or don't have knowledge about them (HTML, CSS), on the contrary, you only need
a little base to start to build something. For me, that is the best thing to learn and also it is fun!
